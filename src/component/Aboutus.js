                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a lot of effort, there is not much profit for Farmer. We are here to help Farmers at every stage in the process of Agriculture.
                        Here, we are showing Daily Market Rates of various Crops in different cities. If any Famer wants to know about any Crop information
                        like when he should plant that Crop, What type of environment that crop is needed to grow in a good manner, and also we are giving 
                        information of how to grow that crop. We are giving Cultivation phase-wise information to Farmer.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes because of bad weather like heavy rain or so much sunny weather, there is the possibility of Crops infected by the disease
                        and after that Farmer does not know what is the solution to that disease or which Pesticide he should use so that Crop is got well 
                        and also he doesn't know from where he should get that Pesticide, that's why here we are providing Shops from where he can able to get
                        pesticide, fertilizer, and seeds for the crops. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, after the crop is grown completely, the farmer needs transport, and the buyer like the Merchant buys his Crop. For the convenience
                        of Farmer, we are providing him the facility to search and get the contact of transporters and Merchant as per city. We are providing the driver 
                        and Merchant list and their contact information so that farmers can contact them to Sell and Transport their Crops.
